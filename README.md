# SnowFox-Data-Analysis
This repository contains scripts and tools used in the research paper "Accurate and autonomous snow water equivalent measurements using a cosmic ray sensor on a Himalayan glacier".
https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-5913-2024

The analysis focuses on processing and visualizing data from COSIPY model outputs, SnowFox processed data, and AWS station measurements. The repository supports calculating daily, monthly, and seasonal changes in snow water equivalent (SWE), as well as comparisons between datasets.

The goal of this repository is to facilitate reproducibility and provide a framework for analyzing and visualizing snow water equivalent data for researchers working on high-altitude cryosphere studies.
